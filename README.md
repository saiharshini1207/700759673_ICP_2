# Description for the FULL_NAME and STRING_ALTERNATIVE CODE:


In that python code we used two functions named "fullname" and "string_alternative".
1)  In the "fullname" function we takes firstname and lastname as input from the user and we merge those seperate input strings as a single string that it joins the two input strings and
   prints the fullname.
2) In the string_alternative" function it takes above fullname as a input and uses the for loop to compare the alternative occurence of the characters in the name and here we also defines
   the empty list and the list will be appended in the alternative occurences after it reaches the length the loop stops and the list is joined as a string and it prints the alternative
   characters in the fullname.





#Description for the word count Program code:

In this Python code we uses the "with" statement to process the file.

1) In this code we uses the two files input.txt contains some words and it will be displayed in the output.txt
2) It also takes the input in a string and a list will be defined by the split statement it splits each word and appends in to the list.
3) And then it counts the occurence of each word in that list and prints the output to the output file in a write mode.
4) Finally, it prints the word and occurence value of the word.


# Description for the conversion of height from inches to centimeters program code:



In that program code used a function named "convert_heights_nested" function
1.  The formula for conversion of inches to cms is *2.54 ( 1 inch=1*2.54 )
2.  In this we also uses a empty list and the it will  be splitted to convert the each input value in to cms given by user.
3.  After converting into the cms the value is appended to the list and then it prints the output.
