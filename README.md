# Description for the FULL_NAME and STRING_ALTERNATIVE CODE:


In that python code we used two functions named "fullname" and "string_alternative".
1)  In the "fullname" function we takes firstname and lastname as input from the user and we merge those seperate input strings as a single string that it joins the two input strings and
   prints the fullname.
2) In the string_alternative" function it takes above fullname as a input and uses the for loop to compare the alternative occurence of the characters in the name and here we also defines
   the empty list and the list will be appended in the alternative occurences after it reaches the length the loop stops and the list is joined as a string and it prints the alternative
   characters in the fullname.

1.  The formula for conversion of inches to cms is *2.54 ( 1 inch=1*2.54 )
2.  In this we also uses a empty list and the it will  be splitted to convert the each input value in to cms given by user.
